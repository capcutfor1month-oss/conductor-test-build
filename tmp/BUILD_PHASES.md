### Phase A — Key decisions locked

- Vault is a folder of Markdown files. Obsidian NOT required for users.
- Plugin scanner runs at install time. Scans VST3/AU/VST paths on macOS.
- Only asks 4 questions: primary EQ / compressor / reverb / saturator.
- These 4 anchor plugins get full operator cards. Rest go into Studio Inventory as "owned."
- Source-of-truth files (already exist in NotebookLM Sources/) get indexed into ChromaDB for public users → replaces NotebookLM for basic use.
- NotebookLM stays as optional power-user feature (connect via Tutorials panel).
- Progressive model: works on day one, unlocks more as user configures.
- **system_prompt.md is the bootloader, not the whole brain. Target: under 200–300 lines. Reference external files — do not inline them.**
- **Context rot (video definition): system_prompt.md gets too big → Claude reads all of it at session start → attention dilutes → rules at the bottom get ignored. Fix: keep it small, point to external files.**
- **ChromaDB degradation is a separate problem** — retrieval quality drops after 150+ sessions due to no time decay, duplicates, contradictions. See LIMITATIONS.md. Not the same as context rot.

### Vault file rules (from video — 200 line rule)

- Every master/index file stays under 200 lines.
- No file dumps everything. Each file = one topic.
- Master files are indexes only — they point to topic files, not contain them.
- Topic detail lives in its own file, loaded only when that topic is relevant.
- Example: `conductor-vault/index.md` lists what exists.
  `conductor-vault/plugins/Pro-Q 4 Operator Card.md` loaded only when Pro-Q 4 is in use.
- system_prompt.md should reference external files, not contain them inline.
- ableton.md should become index.md + separate topic files per failure case.

### Plugin scanner — what it scans (macOS)

```
/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/
~/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/
/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components/
~/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/Components/
/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST/
~/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST/
```

### Plugin scanner — output format

Writes `conductor-vault/Studio Inventory.md` automatically.
Columns: Plugin name | Type | Manufacturer | Operator Card loaded (yes/no)

## PHASE B — CONTEXT PACK
> Goal: vault + memory + live Ableton state actually reaches the AI on every call.
> This is the single biggest gap. Nothing is injected right now.
>
> KEY LESSON FROM VIDEO: Do NOT rely on Claude deciding to search memory.
> Use a HOOK. Fire it automatically. Claude never has to remember to look.
> Delivery model: hook fires → injects index + top 3 matches → every prompt gets context.

| # | What | File/Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Context pack builder | `rag/context_pack_builder.py` | ✅ |
| B2 | Request mode classifier | `rag/request_mode_classifier.py` — 13/13 tests pass | ✅ |
| B3 | Risk classifier | Folded into B2 — risk_reason field in classify() return | ✅ |
| B4 | Wire context pack into UI | `conductorSendToAPI()` in `app/index.html` — real API call, streaming | ✅ |
| B5 | Bridge endpoint for context pack | `GET /context/pack` + `GET /context/system_prompt` in conductor_bridge.py | ✅ |
| B6 | Session-start hook | `conductorSessionStart()` — fires in DOMContentLoaded, fetches system prompt + baseline pack | ✅ |
| B7 | Prompt-submit hook | Inside `conductorSendToAPI()` — fetches fresh context pack per message | ✅ |
| B8 | Pre-risky-action hook | Inline confirmation UI in chat — blocks RISKY_WRITE until user approves | ✅ |
| B9 | Context Pack Debug view | Collapsible debug block after every AI response — mode, risk, sources, tokens, memories | ✅ |
| B10 | Session pack versioning | `session_pack_version` (ISO timestamp) + `state_hash` (12-char MD5) in `/context/session` response | ✅ |
| B11 | Stale session auto-refresh | If pack age > 30s before any RISKY action → auto-refresh Layer B first, then confirm | ✅ |
| B12 | Mode/risk at top of Layer C | `## MESSAGE PACK` header with Mode/Risk/Confirmation leads every message pack — Claude sees intent before context | ✅ |
| B13 | Dev mode | DEV toolbar button — auto-opens debug blocks, shows raw session pack excerpt, persisted to localStorage | ✅ |

### Request mode classifier — 5 modes

```
MENTOR          → advice, education, explanation. No tools needed.
INTERN_READ     → inspect Ableton/session/audio/memory. Tools OK.
INTERN_WRITE_SAFE   → small reversible change. Define result, execute, verify.
INTERN_WRITE_RISKY  → master/delete/export/batch/replace plugin. Confirm first.
CLARIFY         → request is ambiguous or unsafe without one answer.
```

### Context pack format — Three layers sent to Anthropic

**Layer A** — `system:` param — always sent every call. Never in user content.
```
You are Conductor, Adi's personal AI music production assistant…
```

**Layer B** — Session pack — injected once at session start, refreshed on state change.
Includes `session_pack_version` (ISO timestamp) and `state_hash` (12-char MD5) for staleness detection.
```md
## PRODUCER DNA
Producer: Adi | Level: Stage 3 diploma | Primary genre: Bollywood/Punjabi
Sound: cinematic · punchy · emotional | Anchor plugins: Pro-Q 4 · Ozone 12

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE
Project: [name] | Stage: [0-4] | BPM: [x] | Key: [x]

## TOOL STATUS
Ableton: connected | Audio Analyzer: available | Memory (ChromaDB): ready
```

**Layer C** — Message pack — fresh every message. Mode/risk leads — Claude sees intent before context.
```md
## MESSAGE PACK
Mode: INTERN_WRITE_RISKY
Risk: HIGH
Confirmation required: YES
Reason: Ozone 12 on master bus — HIGH risk plugin

Relevant retrieved context:

### Memory
1. [top ChromaDB result — 200 chars]
2. [second result]
3. [third result]

## OPERATOR CARD — Ozone 12
[Identity + Risky Writes + Never Do sections only]
```

**Staleness rules:**
- Layer B age > 30s before any `INTERN_WRITE_RISKY` → auto-refresh before confirm gate
- `state_hash` stored by UI; if bridge poll returns a different hash → force refresh
- Risky operations covered: master bus, Ozone, delete, export, routing, tempo/key, batch

---

## PHASE B — KEY ADDITIONS (logged here for completeness)
> Phase B completed before this file existed in detail. Adding the key decisions that were locked.

### Protection Model (added late Phase B)
`rag/protection_model.py` — replaces flat SAFE/RISKY with a 6-level protection model:
```
STATUS_ONLY          → advice/read — no write
AUTO_EXECUTE_ALLOWED → safe reversible write — execute directly
UNDO_LOG_REQUIRED    → medium reversible write (patch replace, randomise)
CONFIRM_REQUIRED     → dangerous/global/master/export — user must confirm
CLARIFY_REQUIRED     → unclear pronoun target — ask one question first
BLOCK_UNSUPPORTED    → GUI/mouse actions — can't execute, explain why
```

### Risk Taxonomy (added late Phase B)
`rag/risk_taxonomy.py` — generalization-first risky action classification:
- ACTION_CATEGORIES (delete, master_level, freeze_flatten, plugin_replace, …)
- Known plugins database at `data/known_plugins.json` (54 entries + camelCase aliases)
- Operator card file lookup by plugin alias (`get_card_file_for_message()`)
- `classify_risk()` returns `{is_risky, category, matched, reason}`

### Memory Write Contract (added late Phase B)
Every `POST /memory` caller must include: `mode`, `collection`, valid metadata, `source_type`.
Documented in `app/system_prompt.md` under `## MEMORY WRITE CONTRACT`.
Enforced in `conductor_bridge.py` — mode-absent writes get a `warnings[]` in response,
FREEFORM_GENERAL writes to project collection are hard-blocked (HTTP 400).

---

## PHASE C — RETRIEVAL QUALITY
> Goal: smarter search. Right memory reaches the AI, not just any memory.
> Status: ✅ COMPLETE. All 28 sections of phase_c_eval_set.py pass / 0 fail.
> Codex review: PASS (all C1–C6 sub-steps reviewed and signed off, no revert needed).

### C1 — 5 Collections (multi-index split)

| Collection | Memory type | What it stores | Similarity threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| `producer_memory_index` | Semantic | Producer taste, habits, confirmed preferences | 0.35 |
| `project_session_index` | Episodic | Current-song decisions and history | 0.40 |
| `plugin_operator_index` | Procedural/archival | Plugin capability, param maps, quirks, operator cards | 0.30 |
| `failure_cases_index` | Procedural/safety | PluginBridge/LOM failures, known bugs, confirmed fixes | 0.30 |
| `audio_analysis_index` | Measurement/evidence | LUFS, spectrum, stereo width snapshots | 0.50 |

**Source-of-truth:** `rag/memory_schema.py` — never hardcode collection names elsewhere.

### C1 — Mode → Collection routing (updated in Phase C, late)

Applied LangMem/Letta/MIRIX taxonomy. Plugin data no longer dumped into producer_memory_index.

| Mode | Collections searched |
|---|---|
| `MENTOR` | producer · plugin_operator · failure (advisory) |
| `INTERN_READ` | project · producer · plugin_operator · audio |
| `INTERN_WRITE_SAFE` | producer · plugin_operator · failure |
| `INTERN_WRITE_RISKY` | failure · plugin_operator · producer · audio (safety-first order) |
| `CLARIFY` | producer |
| `FREEFORM_GENERAL` | (none) |

**Key routing decisions:**
- `MENTOR` now includes `failure_cases_index`: advisory "what went wrong" queries need failure context. No execution risk — MENTOR is retrieval-only.
- `INTERN_READ` now includes `plugin_operator_index` (show plugin params) and `audio_analysis_index` (show LUFS).
- `project_session_index` excluded from `INTERN_WRITE_RISKY`: session history is noise before a dangerous write.
- RISKY order enforced by `RISKY_WRITE_RETRIEVAL_ORDER` — safety rules first, not alphabetical.

### C2 — Temporal memory scoring

```python
final_score = semantic × 0.60 + recency × 0.30 + frequency × 0.10
```
- Recency: exponential decay, half-life = 7 days
- Level 4 memories always score 9999 — bypass threshold + float to top
- Missing `created_at` → recency = 0.5 (neutral, no crash)
- Global sort across all collections after C3 check

### C3 — Corrective RAG (two-layer contradiction protection)

**Layer 1 — Write-time:**
- After `col.add()` in `conductor_bridge.py`, `find_superseded_by_new()` runs
- Jaccard similarity (threshold 0.70) against recent memories in same collection
- Old matching memories get `superseded_by=new_id` written back to ChromaDB metadata
- Bridge response includes `superseded: [old_id, …]` for transparency

**Layer 2 — Read-time (in-flight):**
- `apply_corrective_check()` called in `retrieve()` after all collections queried
- Groups items by collection, compares pairs with Jaccard (threshold 0.40)
- Newer item (lower `age_days`) wins; on tie, higher `final_score` wins
- Loser gets `injected=False`, `reason="in-flight superseded by X (C3 contradiction: Jaccard=Y)"`
- Cross-collection: no suppression — failure memory never suppresses producer memory

### C1 Step 1 — Evidence Label Completeness (11 new fields)

Every `EvidenceItem` now exposes 11 additional completeness fields beyond the C4 originals:
```
source_type · verification_status · bm25_score · reason_injected · token_count
project_id · session_id · plugin_id · freshness · rescue_mode · conflict_flag
```
`reason_injected` normalization: `_apply_threshold()` sets it; `apply_corrective_check()` can later flip `injected=True→False` — a normalization pass after C3 corrects `"retrieval_match"` to `"not_injected"` on any suppressed item.

### C2 — Context Pack Audit Logging

`rag/context_pack_logger.py` — writes one JSONL record per `/context/pack` call to `memory/context_pack_log.jsonl`.
Record: timestamp, query, mode, protection_level, risk_category, pack_chars, token_estimate, memory_hits, injected_count, plugin_card, freeform, evidence (all 25 fields + text_preview), skipped list.
Best-effort: logging failure never breaks `/context/pack`. Thread-safe via `threading.Lock()`.

### C3 — Token Budget / Drop Policy

`rag/token_budget.py` — `apply_token_budget()` called in `retrieve()` after `final_score` is set.
Budget: `DEFAULT_BUDGET_TOKENS = 2000`. Drops lowest-priority injected items first.
Priority tiers (never dropped = P0/P1):
```
P0 memory_level == 4           Never-Do — absolutely protected
P1 failure_cases_index         safety evidence — protected
P2 memory_level == 3           dropped last after P0/P1 exhausted
P3 memory_level == 2
P4 memory_level == 1 or unknown   dropped first
```
Within tier: lowest `final_score` dropped first. Hard stop at P0/P1 — accepts budget overrun rather than drop safety evidence.
Dropped items: `injected=False`, `reason="token_budget_exceeded"`, `reason_injected="not_injected"`. Remain in `debug.evidence`.

### C4 — Evidence Labels + Scope-aware Corrective RAG

Original C4 — every `EvidenceItem` exposes:
```
id · confidence · age_days · final_score · superseded_by · rejected
```
Every `debug.evidence` dict in `/context/pack` response exposes 25 fields total (14 original C4 + 11 C1 Step 1).

Short source labels: `[producer]`, `[project]`, `[plugin]`, `[failure]`
BM25 rescue items: `[producer·bm25]`, `[producer·bm25_exact]`
Audio freshness items: `[audio·fresh]`, `[audio·stale] ⚠`, `[audio·old] ⚠`

**C4 scope-aware enhancement** (`rag/corrective_check.py`):
- Different non-empty `project_id` on both items → skip (different projects can't conflict)
- Different non-empty `plugin_id` on both items → set `conflict_flag=True` on both, no suppression
- Same project_id (or both empty) + same plugin_id (or both empty) → existing Jaccard logic unchanged

### C5 — Hybrid BM25 Search + Undo Log Skeleton

**Hybrid BM25 search** (original C5):
Strategy: semantic-first with BM25 rescue.
1. ChromaDB cosine similarity search (primary)
2. BM25 (`rank_bm25.BM25Okapi`) on full collection — rescues exact plugin names, bus names, failure codes
3. BM25 hits not already in semantic results → added with `similarity=0.45`
4. Items found by both: keep semantic similarity
`BM25_RESCUE_SIMILARITY = 0.45` — above all collection thresholds (0.30–0.40), below audio 0.50 by design.
Graceful fallback: if `rank_bm25` not installed → BM25 step silently skipped.

**Undo log skeleton** (`rag/undo_log.py`):
Append-only JSONL to `memory/undo_log.jsonl`. Three operations:
- `create_undo_record(action_type, prior_state, **kwargs)` → `record_id` — written before action, `executed=False`
- `mark_executed(record_id)` → appends `{executed:True}` outcome record
- `mark_failed(record_id, error)` → appends `{failed:True, error:...}` outcome record
- `UndoLogRequiredError` — raised if `protection_level="UNDO_LOG_REQUIRED"` and `prior_state` is missing/empty
Scope: skeleton only — infrastructure for pre-execution state capture. Full rollback (re-applying prior_state to Ableton LOM) is Phase D.

### Memory levels (unchanged from design)

```
Level 1 — Raw event         (weak — session only, eligible to expire)
Level 2 — Session decision  (medium — project-specific, kept across sessions)
Level 3 — Confirmed preference (strong — cross-project, user explicitly approved)
Level 4 — Producer rule / Never-Do (strongest — always retrieved, bypasses threshold)

### C6 — BM25 Exact Recall Hardening

`_bm25_tokenize(text)` added to `routed_retriever.py` — replaces naive `.lower().split()` in `_bm25_rescue()`:
- Splits on `_`, `-`, `.` separators and keeps both parts and compound
- Splits alpha runs from digit runs (e.g. `Ozone12` → `ozone`, `12`, `ozone12`)
- Handles: `Pro-Q`, `ProQ4`, `Ozone12`, `F006`, `BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_003`, `LowShelf_Gain`, `Kick_Bus_01`

`rescue_mode="bm25_exact"` set when BM25 score ≥ top score × `BM25_EXACT_FRACTION` (0.75). Otherwise `"bm25"`.
Label reflects: `[producer·bm25_exact]` vs `[producer·bm25]`.

Content-hash dedup: `hashlib.md5(doc)` tracked within each `_bm25_rescue()` call — same text with different ChromaDB IDs not added twice.

BM25 rescue still respects mode/routing/protection — it runs per-collection inside the existing routing loop, same `_apply_threshold()` and C3 checks apply.

### Phase C — Key files

## PHASE D — TRUST LAYER
> Goal: producer can see what changed, approve it, and Conductor learns from the answer.
>
> KEY LESSON FROM VIDEO: Memory promotion ("dreaming") runs at SESSION END silently.
> Not when user says "remember this." Automatically. Scores decisions by recency + repetition.
> Promotes Level 1 → 2 → 3 → 4. Forgets stale one-offs. Never saves guesses.

| # | What | File/Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-S14 | `_EXPLORER_MODES = {"MENTOR", "FREEFORM_GENERAL"}` — modes that trigger explorer path | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |

| D-S14 | `call_knowledge_explorer()` — single LLM call: JSON with `answer` (user-facing) + `candidates` (internal). Parses structured response; hardens fallback path with regex structural detection | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S14 | `_build_explorer_instructions(session_available)` — injects session-availability note into LLM context | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S14 | Explorer routing in `_handle_orchestrate`: MENTOR/FREEFORM_GENERAL → explorer; READ/CLARIFY → direct; WRITE → action | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S14 | Phase D Slice 14 eval suite | `tests/phase_d_slice14_eval.py` — D135–D142, 8/8 PASS | ✅ |

**What Build 6 hardening fixed (final pass):**
- `_INTERNAL_MARKERS` tuple (5 quoted-only markers) replaced with `_STRUCTURAL_RE` — catches all 9 schema keys in any form: quoted, unquoted, YAML-style, mixed-case, word-boundary
- Added `startswith("```")` markdown-fence detection to `_looks_structural`
- Previously: `candidates: cut EQ\ndirection: ...` (unquoted YAML) and `CANDIDATES:` (mixed-case) bypassed the guard and could leak raw schema text to the user — now caught
- `_check_no_internal_exposure` in test helper updated to mirror production regex; Sub-D/E/F added to D137

### Phase D — Slice 15 (Creative Critic v1 — Build 7) ✅ LOCKED

> **Do not reopen unless a regression appears in `tests/phase_d_slice15_eval.py`.**

| # | What | File/Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-S15 | `call_creative_critic()` — single LLM call evaluating Explorer candidates on 6 criteria (genericity, session_grounding, session_contradiction, goal_fit, practicality, unsupported_assumptions). Returns `({}, tokens)` on parse failure or invalid index. Never raises to caller. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S15 | `_build_critic_prompt()` + `_CRITIC_JSON_SCHEMA` — compact prompt with 6 evaluation criteria; JSON schema specifying `selected`, `kept`, `rejected`, `reasons`, `critic_summary` | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S15 | `_compose_final_answer(explorer_answer, explorer_data, critic_data)` — deterministic composer (no LLM). Builds `"{direction}. {rationale}."` from Critic-selected candidate. Falls back to `explorer_answer` on empty critic, invalid index, missing direction, or `_STRUCTURAL_RE` fire. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S15 | `_handle_orchestrate` Explorer branch updated — calls `call_creative_critic` after `call_knowledge_explorer`, then `_compose_final_answer`. Sends `"text": final_text` (Critic-filtered) instead of raw `answer_text`. Critic failure is non-fatal. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S15 | Phase D Slice 15 eval suite | `tests/phase_d_slice15_eval.py` — D143–D153, 11/11 PASS | ✅ |

**Known limitation (do not reopen Build 7):**
`_compose_final_answer()` outputs `"{direction}. {rationale}."` — safe and correct but plain. Future polish: smoother sentence flow, session-fact weaving, co-producer voice. Track as: "Critic composer polish — post Build 7". New slice only.

| D-S17 | Build 9: Operator Card YAML frontmatter (`card_id`, `display_name`, `type`, `risk_level`, `verification_status`, `collection`, `tags`, `operator_card_triggers`) added to all 4 cards. | `conductor-vault/plugins/*.md` | ✅ |
| D-S17 | Build 10: `_get_stable_card_id(card_file)` — reads frontmatter `card_id`, returns `vault_plugin_{card_id}`. Fails closed. | `rag/context_pack_builder.py` | ✅ |
| D-S17 | Build 10 Guard A: when `_detect_plugin()` fires for plugin X, the ChromaDB full-body card for X is excluded from the Memory section (file-based snippet is authoritative). | `rag/context_pack_builder.py` | ✅ |

### Phase D — Slice 19 (Knowledge Status Context to Critic — Build 12) ✅ LOCKED

| # | What | File/Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-S19 | `_extract_knowledge_status_context(message_pack_text, max_chars=600)` — extracts `## KNOWLEDGE STATUS` block from `/context/pack` text; stops at next `##` section; returns `""` if absent. Mirrors `_extract_operator_card_context()`. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S19 | `_build_critic_prompt()` — `knowledge_status_context=""` param added; injects `## Plugin Knowledge Context` block (internal only) when present, instructing Critic to apply `knowledge_evidence` criterion and penalize unacknowledged plugin-specific claims. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S19 | `call_creative_critic()` — `knowledge_status_context=""` param added; passed through to `_build_critic_prompt()`. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S19 | `_handle_orchestrate()` — extracts `knowledge_status_context` from `message_pack_text` and passes to `call_creative_critic()` alongside `card_context`. Closes the gap where `knowledge_evidence` had no direct context. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S19 | `_TRUST_LABEL_RE` — new module-level regex guarding 6 internal trust labels: `KNOWLEDGE STATUS`, `Plugin Knowledge Context`, `Operator card: not available`, `knowledge_evidence`, `confidence <=`, `confidence ≤`. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S19 | `_compose_final_answer()` — trust-label guard added: if selected-candidate `direction` or `rationale` contains any `_TRUST_LABEL_RE` match, falls back to `explorer_answer` (same pattern as existing `_STRUCTURAL_RE` guard). Blocks Build 11/12 internal labels from leaking into user-facing composed text. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S19 | Phase D Slice 19 eval suite | `tests/phase_d_slice19_eval.py` — D177–D186, 10/10 PASS | ✅ |

### Phase D — Slice 20 (Critic Composer Polish — Build 13) ✅ LOCKED

> **Do not reopen unless a regression appears in `tests/phase_d_slice20_eval.py`.**

| # | What | File/Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-S20 | `_compose_final_answer()` — em-dash prose join for short directions (≤ 8 words); period join for longer. Strip trailing punctuation before joining so connectors land cleanly. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S20 | `_safe_session_facts(facts)` — new helper; filters `session_facts_used` entries for user-facing safety. Drops: JSON-looking facts (`{`, `[`), internal key:value metadata (`mode:`, `risk:`, `score:`, `selected:`, `kept:`, `rejected:`), ID references (`proof id`, `request id`, `action id` — space form; underscore forms caught by snake_case check), `_STRUCTURAL_RE` matches, `_TRUST_LABEL_RE` matches, Operator Card refs, markdown headers, snake_case keys, entries > 60 chars. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S20 | `_compose_final_answer()` — light session_facts_used weaving: novel safe facts (at most 2, not already in composed text) appended as parenthetical `(fact1, fact2).` | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S20 | `tests/phase_d_slice16_eval.py` — D154/D157 assertions updated for em-dash format ("Use gentle Ozone mastering moves" is 6 words). | `tests/phase_d_slice16_eval.py` | ✅ |

### Phase D — Slice 21 (CLARIFY Mode Hardening — Build 14) ✅ LOCKED

> **Do not reopen unless a regression appears in `tests/phase_d_slice21_eval.py`.**

| # | What | File/Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-S21 | `_CLARIFY_LABEL_RE` — module-level regex (re.IGNORECASE) guarding internal category/label names from leaking into composed clarify questions: `clarify`, `clarify_required`, `unclear_target`, `unclear_scope`, `too_short`, `unsupported_manual_gui`, `risk_category`, `protection_level`, `block_unsupported`, `mode:`, `risk:`, `protection:`. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S21 | `_CLARIFY_VERB_RE` — module-level regex extracting action verbs from ambiguous pronoun messages (lower, raise, boost, cut, compress, route, pan, mute, solo, arm, filter, eq, bypass, enable, disable, rename, color, duplicate, create, load, send, add, remove, set, adjust, apply, change). | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S21 | `_clarify_safe(question)` — safety guard; returns `""` if output is not a question (no `?`) or contains `_CLARIFY_LABEL_RE` / `_STRUCTURAL_RE` / `_TRUST_LABEL_RE` matches. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S21 | `_compose_clarify_question(original_text, risk_reason, risk_category)` — deterministic composer, no LLM call. Template map: `unclear*` → `"Which track or plugin should I {verb}?"` (verb from `_CLARIFY_VERB_RE`); `too_short` → `"What would you like to do — could you say a bit more?"`; `*scope*` → `"Which track, bus, or plugin are you working on?"`; generic fallback from `risk_reason` if safe; BLOCK/unknown → `""`. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S21 | `_handle_orchestrate()` — extracts `risk_reason` and `risk_category` from `pack_data`. CLARIFY fast-path inserted before context assembly: if `_compose_clarify_question()` returns a non-empty string, responds immediately with `type:"clarify"`, zero LLM tokens. Falls through to `call_knowledge_answer()` when composer returns `""`. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S21 | Phase D Slice 21 eval suite | `tests/phase_d_slice21_eval.py` — D197–D204, 8/8 PASS | ✅ |

### Phase D — Slice 28 (Taste Context Injection v1 — Build 21) ✅ LOCKED

> **Do not reopen unless a regression appears in `tests/phase_d_slice28_eval.py`.**

| # | What | File/Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-S28 | `rag/taste_context.py` — reads `session_reflection_log.jsonl`, filters `accepted_signals` through 4 gates, returns compact `## Taste Context` block or `""`. | `rag/taste_context.py` | ✅ |
| D-S28 | Gate 1: scope must be `session_only` or `session_project`. Gate 2: no negative feedback types. Gate 3: `suggested_level` ≤ 2. Gate 4: `session_project` requires both `project_id` non-empty and matching. | `rag/taste_context.py` | ✅ |
| D-S28 | `_is_clean_text()` — rejects internal labels, schema field names, space-separated ID labels, key:value pairs (`action:`, `target:`, `track:Kick`), all-caps enums, JSON, long hex tokens (12+ chars), UUIDs. | `rag/taste_context.py` | ✅ |
| D-S28 | Soft import in `harness_server.py` — `from rag.taste_context import build_taste_context as _load_taste_context` with try/except no-op fallback. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S28 | `_TRUST_LABEL_RE` extended with `\|Taste\s+Context` — blocks taste block from leaking into `_compose_final_answer` output. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S28 | `_build_critic_prompt()` + `call_creative_critic()` — `taste_context=""` param added; injected as internal-only block with "do not surface" instruction. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S28 | Taste context loaded inside `if mode in _EXPLORER_MODES:` branch only — WRITE/action path never touched. | `tools/harness_server.py` | ✅ |
| D-S28 | Phase D Slice 28 eval suite | `tests/phase_d_slice28_eval.py` — D282–D297, 80/80 PASS | ✅ |

### Phase D — Slice 29 (Session-End Hook v1 — Build 22) ✅ LOCKED

> **Do not reopen unless a regression appears in `tests/phase_d_slice29_eval.py`.**

| # | What | File/Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-S29 | `rag/session_end.py` — thin orchestrator: Step 1 promotion → Step 2 reflection → Step 3 memory write | `rag/session_end.py` | ✅ |

### Phase D — Expanded Actions Roadmap (not built — roadmap only)

| Slice | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Expanded Slice 3B | `POST /action/plugin_param` — PluginBridge parameter control | ❌ Roadmap |
| Expanded Slice 3C | PluginBridge placement on track (load PluginBridge VST3, select plugin) | ❌ Roadmap |
| Expanded Slice 3D | `POST /action/plugin_load` — load plugin via LOM or PluginBridge | ❌ Roadmap |
| Expanded Slice 4 | Export / Bounce — pending explicit user decision | ❌ Roadmap |
| Expanded Slice 5 | Clip / scene / session-view actions — pending user approval of scope | ❌ Roadmap |

### Phase D — Product Layer (not built — roadmap only)

| # | What | File/Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| D6 | Feedback UI buttons | `app/index.html` — Keep / Undo / Too much / Not enough / Wrong direction wired to `POST /feedback` | ❌ Roadmap |
| D7 | Session-end hook | Triggers `memory_promotion.py` on session close; summarise session, extract decisions | ❌ Roadmap |
| D3 | Memory promotion — "dreaming" | `rag/memory_promotion.py` — promotion candidate generator; scores feedback events, generates structured candidates Level 1–2 | ✅ LOCKED — Build 18 (9b63bac) |
| UI | CoProducer Translation layer | **Required before friend-test** — wraps ActionProofs + errors in assistant dialogue; no raw JSON/enums to user | ❌ Roadmap |
| UI | Drift diff dialog | Premium modal on drift-blocked undo | ❌ Roadmap |
| UI | Studio timeline / visual debugger | Visual view of `action_log.jsonl` | ❌ Roadmap |

**UI rule (locked):** `app/index.html` is prototype-only. `CoProducerResponse` translation layer required before friend-test deployment. No raw JSON or error enums in production UI.

### Phase D — Slice 4 Recommendation for Slice 5

1. Batch undo — `proof_ids: [...]`; execute in reverse-chronological order; per-proof results
2. Undo chain — `parent_proof_id` tracking so undo-of-undo is detectable/decidable
3. Action log fallback — look up `before_state` from `action_log.jsonl` when proof exists there but not in proof log
4. Session undo summary — `GET /action/undo/list` returning all undo-eligible proofs
5. Memory promotion from feedback — UNDO feedback type + confirmed undo proof → eligible for Phase C promotion

### Phase C — Cleanup (May 2026) ✅

| What | File | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `len(None)` crash in retriever | `rag/routed_retriever.py` — both occurrences of `len(doc) // 4` → `len(doc or "") // 4` | ✅ |
| Stale ChromaDB seeds on crash | `tests/phase_c_eval_set.py` — C5 + MT21 seed blocks wrapped in `try/finally` | ✅ |
| Manual stale seed cleanup | 9 stale `c5_f003_*` and `mt21_*` timestamp IDs deleted from ChromaDB | ✅ |
| Phase C eval idempotent | `tests/phase_c_eval_set.py` — confirmed ✅ on 2 consecutive runs | ✅ |

### Feedback outcome format (stored in ChromaDB)

```md
Action: Pro-Q 4 Band 2 — 3.4kHz / -1.5dB / Q2.2
Project: [name] | Stage: [x] | Genre: [x]
User feedback: Too much
Learning: For this producer, vocal presence cuts should start at -1.0dB not -1.5dB
Memory level: Level 3
```

---

## PHASE E — ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE
> Goal: graph relationships, reference tracks, evaluation, observability.
> Do not start until Phase D is complete and stable.

| # | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | Graph RAG (LightRAG) | ❌ |
| E2 | Reference Track DNA | ❌ |
| E3 | Audio feature memory | ❌ |
| E4 | Evaluated RAG test suite (Ragas) | ❌ |
| E5 | Langfuse / Phoenix tracing | ❌ |

---

## PHASE F — TEAMS & HOSTED KNOWLEDGE BASE
> Goal: the entire conductor-vault becomes a living, team-maintained knowledge base.
> Not just operator cards — plugin manuals, music theory, genre references, techniques.
> Team members contribute from anywhere. Adi approves. All Conductor instances sync.
> Do not start until Phase E is stable OR until Conductor has public users — whichever comes first.
>
> Shares infrastructure with the Error Collection pipeline (project.md).
> One hosted server handles: knowledge submissions + error collection + vault sync.

| # | What | File/Path | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Hosted server | `server/main.py` (FastAPI — Railway / Supabase / Render) | ❌ |
| F2 | Auth system | JWT or Supabase Auth — roles: viewer / contributor / approver | ❌ |
| F3 | POST /knowledge/submit | Unified endpoint — any knowledge type, any vault folder | ❌ |
| F4 | GET /knowledge/pending | Adi reviews all pending submissions in one place | ❌ |
| F5 | POST /knowledge/approve | Adi approves → worker applies → vault updated | ❌ |
| F6 | Worker Claude Code (server-side) | Headless sub-agent — validates + applies all knowledge types | ❌ |
| F7 | GET /vault/sync | Conductor pulls latest vault on session start | ❌ |
| F8 | Approval notifications | Email / Conductor UI — "3 pending submissions need review" | ❌ |
| F9 | Error collection merged in | Anonymous error patterns feed into same server | ❌ |
| F10 | Team review panel | Web UI — pending / approved / rejected per knowledge area | ❌ |
| F11 | Knowledge area permissions | Who can submit to which folder (contributor map) | ❌ |
| F12 | Version history per file | Git-style — every approved update is a versioned snapshot | ❌ |

---

### Phase F — Knowledge Areas Covered

| Folder | Content type | Team-editable? | Risk | Needs Adi approval? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `plugins/` | Operator cards | ✅ Yes | medium–HIGH | Yes for risky-write / never-do |
| `references/techniques/` | EQ approaches, mixing, orchestration | ✅ Yes | low | No — auto-apply after worker review |
| `references/genres/` | Genre targets, arrangement templates | ✅ Yes | low | No — auto-apply after worker review |
| `references/manuals/` | Plugin manual notes | ✅ Yes | low | No — auto-apply after worker review |
| `references/reference_tracks/` | Reference track DNA | ✅ Yes | low | No — auto-apply after worker review |
| `producer/producer_dna.md` | Taste, workflow, permissions | ❌ Adi only | — | N/A — locked |
| `producer/never_do_rules.md` | Hard safety rules | ❌ Adi only | HIGH | N/A — locked |
| `failure-cases/` | Confirmed LOM failures | ✅ Yes | medium | Yes — affects live session safety |

---

### Phase F — Unified Submission Format

One format covers all knowledge types. `target_file` routes it to the right vault folder.

```md
### KNOWLEDGE UPDATE — [short title]
- Submitted by: [name / GitHub handle]
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Target file: conductor-vault/[folder]/[filename].md
- Knowledge type: [ ] operator-card  [ ] technique  [ ] genre  [ ] manual-note  [ ] reference-track  [ ] failure-case
- Risk: [ ] low  [ ] medium  [ ] high
- Confidence: [ ] confirmed  [ ] suspected  [ ] from-source (cite it)

**What to add / change:**
[Exact text, table row, or code block to insert. Worker applies verbatim.]

**Why:**
[One sentence — what this adds or corrects.]

**Source (if from-source):**
[URL, manual page, or reference name.]

**Verification:**
[How worker should check this before applying.]
```

---

### Phase F — Architecture

```
Team member (anywhere)
  → POST /knowledge/submit  (authenticated)
  → Server stores in pending queue by knowledge type + risk level
  ↓
  Low risk (technique / genre / manual) → auto-queued for worker
  Medium / High risk (operator card / failure case) → queued for Adi review
  ↓
Adi notification → reviews medium/high items
  → POST /knowledge/approve or /reject  (with optional note)
  ↓
Worker Claude Code (server-side headless)
  → reads WORKER_INSTRUCTIONS.md (global rules)
  → reads knowledge-type-specific rules
  → applies to correct vault file, bumps version, updates changelog
  ↓
GET /vault/sync → all linked Conductor instances pull updated files
  ↓
ChromaDB on each instance updated (POST /memory → correct collection)
```

---

### Phase F — Minimum to unlock (MVP)

```
F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 + F5  →  usable by a team of 3–5 people
F6 (server-side worker)  →  can stay as local bash trigger in MVP
F7 (vault sync)          →  required for public users
F10 (review panel)       →  nice-to-have, Adi can use API directly at first
```

---

### Phase F — Shares with Error Collection

```
Same server, same deployment:
  POST /knowledge/submit     ← team knowledge contributions
  POST /errors               ← anonymous error patterns from all users
  GET  /vault/sync           ← Conductor instances pull latest vault
  GET  /updates/check        ← check if new files available
```

Both need a hosted server. One deployment, two jobs.

---

### Phase F — What changes in operator cards when live

- Remove manual bash trigger from each card's Worker Config
- Replace with: `submit_endpoint: https://conductor.app/api/knowledge/submit`
- Pending Updates section replaced by server queue (file becomes read-only display)
- Applied Changelog auto-synced — not hand-edited

---

## THINGS TO ADD TO SESSION MANAGEMENT.md
> These came out of the Producer Trust System review and external research.
> Add these in the next SESSION MANAGEMENT.md update pass.

| # | What to add | Source |
|---|---|---|
| S1 | Memory levels 1–4 — how session decisions get stored and promoted | Trust system review + research doc section 17 |
| S2 | Project Taste Memory — separate from global taste. Project may intentionally be different from producer's usual style | Trust system review #12 |
| S3 | Memory consolidation at session end — raw logs → extract decisions → confirm → save durable memory | Research doc section 12 (Memory Consolidation RAG) |
| S4 | Approval/rejection loop tied to session — feedback (Keep/Undo/Too much/Not enough) stored against session context | Trust system review #7 + research doc section 18 |
| S5 | Request mode classifier in session context — MENTOR/INTERN_READ/SAFE_WRITE/RISKY_WRITE/CLARIFY prepended to session state | Research doc section 16 |

## THE 7 MEMORY LAYERS — CONDUCTOR SPECIFIC
> Source: AI review of YouTube video, music-production-specific adaptation.
> This is the definitive memory model for Conductor. Build toward this layer by layer.

| Layer | Name | Loaded when | What it contains | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | Boot Context | Always | system_prompt.md — identity, routing, safety, tool rules, how to retrieve more | Done |
| B | Producer DNA | Always | Taste, genres, workflow, permissions. Short. Under 100 lines. | Phase A |
| C | Current Project Context | Ableton open | Project ID, stage, BPM, key, tracks, buses, plugins, current goal, last analysis | Phase B |
| D | Semantic Retrieved Memory | Per prompt (hook) | Top 3 relevant past decisions, preferences, failures for this specific message | Phase B–C |
| E | Plugin Operator Context | When plugin relevant | Operator card for the plugin in use — safe reads, risky writes, quirks, verification | Phase A–B |
| F | Verbatim Audit Recall | ON DEMAND ONLY | Exact timeline of actions — NOT injected normally. Only for: "what happened?", undo, debug, recovery | Phase D |
| G | Knowledge Base / Obsidian RAG | Deep query only | Plugin manuals, genre notes, Ableton API, techniques, reference track DNA | Phase A (files), Phase C (retrieval) |

**Critical rule for Layer F:**
Do NOT inject verbatim audit logs into normal prompts. They create noise.
Only retrieve when user says: "what did we decide?", "why did that change?", "undo what you did", "what worked yesterday?"

**Critical rule for Layer D:**
Semantic search must fire on every prompt via hook — not when Claude decides to search.
"Vocal hurts" must retrieve "harsh upper-mid presence 3.4kHz" even though words don't match.

---

## THE 4 HOOKS — WHEN CONTEXT FIRES
> Every hook fires automatically. Claude never has to remember to retrieve.

| Hook | Fires when | Injects / Does |
|---|---|---|
| **Session start** | Conductor opens with Ableton connected | Memory index + Producer DNA summary + Current project state + Tool/studio health status |
| **Prompt submit** | User sends any message | Semantic search → top 3 relevant matches from producer/project/plugin/failure indexes → compact context pack |
| **Session end** | User closes Conductor or session ends | Summarise session → extract decisions → separate confirmed/rejected/experimental → update project log → trigger memory_promotion.py (dreaming) |
| **Pre-risky action** | Request classified as RISKY_WRITE | Retrieve safety rules + plugin operator card + require confirmation if: master bus, delete, batch edit, export, global tempo/key change |

These 4 hooks ARE Phase B (B6, B7) and Phase D (D7).
Nothing works correctly without them.

---

## CONTEXT PACK PRINCIPLE — SMALLEST CORRECT PACK
> "Smallest correct context pack for this exact request" — not everything, not nothing.

Example — "make the master louder":
```
RETRIEVE:         current stage, master bus safety rules, Ozone 12 operator card,
                  current LUFS/True Peak, producer loudness preferences,
                  reference track target, past rejected mastering moves

DO NOT RETRIEVE:  vocal chain notes, old unrelated sessions,
                  full plugin manuals, all past conversations, all genre docs
```

The context pack builder (Phase B — B1) enforces this.
Semantic router (already built) selects the right indexes.
Risk classifier (Phase B — B3) adds the safety layer.

---

## MEMORY ARCHITECTURE — VIDEO LEVEL MAP
> Source: YouTube video — "6 levels of Claude Code memory systems"
> Maps each level to Conductor's current state and target.

| Level | What | Conductor state | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Native | CLAUDE.md + memory.md | ✅ Done — system_prompt.md + ChromaDB | Keep, improve |
| 2 — Structured + hooks | Index files + session-start hook auto-injects memory | ✅ Done — conductorSessionStart() + Layer B session pack | Phase B ✅ |
| 3 — Semantic injection | user_prompt_submit hook → top 3 matches auto-injected every prompt | ✅ Done — conductorSendToAPI() Layer C with mode header | Phase B ✅ |
| 4 — Verbatim recall + dreaming | Background promotion: session decisions → long-term memory | 🔶 Memory levels designed, promotion not built | Phase D — D3, D7 |
| 5 — LLM Wiki / Knowledge base | Obsidian vault — team writes, Conductor reads | ✅ Vault built + injected. Hybrid search = Phase C | Phase A ✅ / Phase C |
| 6 — Cross-tool universal brain | Postgres/Supabase shared across all AI tools | ❌ Skip for MVP | Phase E or never |

### Three rules from the video to never forget

```
1. Never rely on Claude deciding to search. Use hooks. Inject automatically.
2. Every file is an index or a single topic. Never a dump. 200 line max.
3. Promotion is silent and automatic at session end — not user-triggered.
```

---

## FRAMEWORKS TO USE (do not build from scratch)

| Need | Framework | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestration | LangGraph | Phase B |
| Obsidian ingestion | LangChain ObsidianLoader or LlamaIndex ObsidianReader | Phase B |
| Vector DB (advanced) | Qdrant (upgrade from ChromaDB for plugin/manual indexes) | Phase C |
| Graph RAG | LightRAG | Phase E |
| Evaluation | Ragas | Phase E |
| Tracing | Langfuse | Phase E |

> ChromaDB stays for producer_memory_index (already working).
> Qdrant added for plugin_operator_index and other read-heavy indexes in Phase C.

---

## WHAT IS CONDUCTOR'S MOAT (never outsource these)

DAW action risk classifier
Ableton Context Pack Builder
PluginBridge parameter mapping and verification
Before/after proof system
